## Maximum and Minimum in Given Set of Numbers (Submission Deadline:17/09/19)

Write an assembly program to compute the maximum and minimum values
in a given set of non-zero unsigned integer numbers. Your program
should also compute the total number of integers present in the set (other than
the terminating 0). Note that your program should scan through all the
elements of the set only once. Assume that the memory locations starting at
address data_items contains the given set of integers. For example, the .data
section will look like

```
.data
data_items: .word 10, 4, 28, 100, 8, 0 ;0 is used to terminate the data
```

Add necessary comments to your program for easy readability.
